### Course methodology

During the next week, we'll learn about Geographic Information Systems methods and techniques, that can be used for urban studies and planning.

The learning material is organized in different sections in the left panel. Each section contains links to pieces of open source learning material about a specific aspect or technology around GIS and geospatial technology. Also for each section I will propose optional exercises to help you navigate through the documentation.
