# Webmapping

There are plenty of options when it comes to development libraries for creating webmaps. We'll only focus on a handful of them, which are Open Source and relatively easy to use. 

## Leaflet.js

[LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/index.html) is a very powerful, yet easy library that allows creating webmaps with just a few lines of code. It plays very well with mobile devices and different screen sizes. It has a very good [documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.6.0.html) and some very handy [examples](https://leafletjs.com/examples.html).

Leaflet is quite popular, and it works as the base for other libraries that add functionality on top of it. It also has a growing ecosystem of [plugins](https://leafletjs.com/plugins.html), developed by the community that add or improves the core functionality.

## OpenLayers

[OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) was one of the first options out there, already a few years ago. It's part of the OSGeo foundation and it offers a lot of functionality, and integration with other geospatial products. 

As complexity and functionality grows, things become a bit more difficult to do with this library.

## OpenStreetMap

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a collaborative map of the world. We could understand it as "the Wikipedia of maps". 

It's not exactly a development library, but it is really useful a as global geospatial database containing information about streets, buildings, roads, national parks, points of interests and much more. 

Checkout the [**Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team**](https://www.hotosm.org/) which is a 100% volunteer international team dedicated to humanitarian action and community development. They organize "mapathons" all around the world when there is a humanitarian crisis, to map the land and help the NGOs deployed in the field.

## MapboxGL.js and Mapbox.js

Mapbox has [its own alternatives for webmapping](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/web-apps/). They're designed to work with the rest of the Mapbox ecosystem.

## CARTO.js and CARTO VL

CARTO also has its own libraries for loading data layers and create interactive webmaps and visualizations, working along with the rest of the CARTO stack. 

[CARTO.js](https://carto.com/developers/carto-js/) for raster tiles and [CARTO VL](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/) for vector tiles.


## Exercise

We're going to create a [basic webmap using LeafletJS](leaflet.md). In the exercise, there are links to **live examples**, where you can edit the code and see how the map changes, without fear of breaking anything ;) 

Feel free to explore, change parameters and try and customize the example on your own.
