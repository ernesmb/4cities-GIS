The learning material is organized in different sections in the left panel, following the first two activities that we already did together (the introduction section and the visit to the CARTO office in Madrid). There will be a section matching each of the days when the course would have taken place. Each section contains links to pieces of open source learning material about a specific aspect or technology around GIS and geospatial technology. Also for each section I will propose optional exercises to help you navigate through the documentation. Any question about the material, exercises, or anything else that you would normally ask in class, I will be happy to try and help via email .

Even more importantly, many of them come from a joint community effort (sometimes sponsored by companies or public institutions), and they work following the Open Source principles, which \"grant users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose\" Among these options, QGIS is hands down the most popular choice, as a standalone system or along with other products for different, specific purposes: PostgreSQL / PostGIS , Openlayers , OpenStreetMap , Geoserver , and many, many more. Some of the projects mentioned above are part of OSGeo , The Open Source Geospatial Foundation, that works towards driving global adoption of open geospatial technology. QGIS is also an excellent tool for learning GIS, from the very basics to almost any kind of professional project. There is plenty of high quality learning material available on the web, created and maintained up to date by the QGIS community or third parties. For our course, we will use the Official Training manual . So, first thing is installing QGIS on your computer. There are installers for Windows, Mac and Linux available at the official Download page . You will see that there are two different versions available: 3.12 is the latest version. 3.10 is the Long Term Release (LTR) version. This version is more stable and has an extended support period. The materials we're following are based on this version. Exercises Once installed, these are the recommended exercises: Read this introduction to GIS Dig a bit deeper into different geospatial data types: Vector and Raster Learn about different Coordinate Reference Systems , and try to make a rectangle with an orange's peels ;) Create your first map, following this exercise . You can also try and load a different dataset from Natural Earth Data . Start working with vector data on this exercise . Learn the basics about symbology . Start working with raster data here . The sample data used in the exercises is available here . As explained here , exercises are tagged as \"Basic\" , \"Intermediate\" or \"Advanced\" based on its difficulty or level of expertise required. I'd recommend completing at least the \"Basic\" level exercises, but of course, feel free to try with a higher level if you feel comfortable with it.","title":"QGIS I"},{"location":"03_qgis/#open-source-gis-qgis","text":"There are plenty of options if you need to work with a GIS, that don't imply acquiring a very expensive license or subscribing to an online service.

Cartography and symbolization are crucial for conveying a message through the visualization of geospatial data. The wrong color scheme, data classification or mapping technique can make your map unreadable, create a wrong idea on the reader or even manipulate ideas on purpose. Here is a great post from the Design and Support teams at Mapbox , talking about general best practices applied to mapping pandemic data. On the same topic, here is a very interesting thread about bad practices when mapping Coronavirus data. Reading both references above, you'd notice that they agree upon the need of normalizing the data. Data normalization is a very important step when creating visualizations. Rather than showing absolute values, we should always calculate ratios, percentages, weighted averages, divide by population, by area, or any other operation that gives context to the data and help the map's reader to understand the visualization and the underlying data analysis. For example, without normalization, almost any measure we want to visualize that is relative to human behavior, will look like a population map: there is always more probability of occurence of any phenomenon where there are more people living. Here are XKCD's views on the subject: Once you are more familiar with the first concepts, as loading and visualizing geospatial data, we can start getting into geospatial analysis. The Wikipedia entry about Spatial Analysis is actually a very good introduction to the matter, that I recommend reading carefully. How can geospatial analysis help in Urban Planning / Development? It can help us determine how growing populations affect energy consumption, transportation, public services or housing resources. It also allows for compiling and cross-filtering data from many sources to see how crime, public health, education and housing/real estate outcomes vary by location. (from this article ). New data streams, as such provided by telco companies, mobile GPS data or real-time traffic information can help the urban analyst to draw a new picture of life in the cities. Exercises Add some text labels to your map . Learn the basics about data classification and color ramps . You can also take a look at ColorBrewer , a very well known tool that helps choosing color palettes for maps; and to CARTOcolors , more modern color palettes by Mamata Akella . Learn more about Proportional Symbols , best practices and Cartography principles. Create a printable map layout .
