The learning material is organized in different sections in the left panel, following the first two activities that we already did together (the introduction section and the visit to the CARTO office in Madrid). There will be a section matching each of the days when the course would have taken place. Each section contains links to pieces of open source learning material about a specific aspect or technology around GIS and geospatial technology. Also for each section I will propose optional exercises to help you navigate through the documentation. Any question about the material, exercises, or anything else that you would normally ask in class, I will be happy to try and help via email .

Even more importantly, many of them come from a joint community effort (sometimes sponsored by companies or public institutions), and they work following the Open Source principles, which \"grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose\" Among these options, QGIS is hands down the most popular choice, as a standalone system or along with other products for different, specific purposes: PostgreSQL / PostGIS , Openlayers , OpenStreetMap , Geoserver , and many, many more. Some of the projects mentioned above are part of OSGeo , The Open Source Geospatial Foundation, that works towards driving global adoption of open geospatial technology. QGIS is also an excellent tool for learning GIS, from the very basics to any kind of professional project. There is plenty of high quality learning material available on the web, created and maintained up to date by the QGIS community or third parties. For our course, we will use the Official Training manual . So, first thing is installing QGIS on your computers. There are installers for Windows, Mac and Linux available at the official Download page . You will see that there are two different versions available: 3.12 is the latest version. 3.10 is the Long Term Release (LTR) version. This version is more stable and has an extended support period. The materials we're following are based on this version. Once installed, these are the recommended exercises: Read this introduction to GIS Dig a bit deeper into different geospatial data types: Vector and Raster Learn about different Coordinate Reference Systems , and try to make a rectangle with an orange's peels ;) Create your first map, following this exercise . You can also try and load a different dataset from Natural Earth Data . Start working with vector data on this exercise . Learn the basics about symbology . Start working with raster data here . The sample data used in the exercises is available here . As explained here , exercises are tagged as \"Basic\" , \"Intermediate\" or \"Advanced\" based on its difficulty or level of expertise required. I'd recommend completing at least the \"Basic\" level exercises, but of course, feel free to try with a higher level if you feel comfortable with it.","title":"QGIS I"},{"location":"03_qgis/#open-source-gis-qgis","text":"There are plenty of options if you need to work with a GIS, that don't imply acquiring a very expensive license or subscribing to an online service.
